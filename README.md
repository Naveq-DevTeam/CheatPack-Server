# Naveq CheatPack (Server) [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/uses-js.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)
Google Chrome browser extension that allows you to cheat on learning platforms such as TestðŸ’©ðŸ’©, Quizizz or Brainly.

## Cheats
Cheats are available for:
1. Testportal
   * Allows you to bypass HoNeSt ReSpOnDeNt TeChNoLoGy.
   * **EXPERIMENTAL!** Allows you to bypass the time limit when it is set to a single question.

2. Quizizz
   * Highlights the correct answers.
   * Can answer questions automatically after a given number of seconds.

3. Brainly
   * Allows you to bypass the daily limit for displaying homework answers.

## Known bugs
* On Quizizz, cheat can't get answers to some questions, and as a result you have to answer some of them yourself. In very exceptional cases, a Fatal Error appears saying that it was not possible to get an answer to any of the next questions.

## Contributing
Pull requests are very welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

<b>IMPORTANT!</b>
If you want to make changes to a cheat mechanism, not CheatPack mechanics, open Pull Request in the cheat creator repository. The exception here is Brainly Cheat, which is so simple that there was no need to create a new repository for it.

## Cheat mechanics
Cheats are downloaded from web server, so they're almost up-to-date. Original cheat repos are here: [Testportal](https://github.com/Lumm1t/anti-testportal), [Quizizz](https://github.com/EastArctica/JS-Plugins).

## Motivation
I just wanted to do anything other than watching anime and I created this CheatPack lol
