# How to contribute

Wow, anyone is reading this, congratulations!
Read this file if you want to contribute to CheatPack.

## Testing

If you are making Pull Request, be sure that it works for you.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/Naveq-DevTeam/CheatPack/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using tabs.
  * We **ALWAYS** put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.
  * This is open source project. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
  * If you want to improve a cheat, not CheatPack, contribute to them on their repositories: [Testportal Cheat Repo](https://github.com/Lumm1t/anti-testportal/), [Quizizz Cheat Repo](https://github.com/EastArctica/JS-Plugins)

Thanks,
Naveq
